I was born in Georgia. I was born in Wrightsville Georgia say they move. ,,A,00:01:29;03,00:01:35;02,Auntie,Now to Dublin Georgia and I came here when I was 10 years or came to Staten Island when I was 10 years old. ,,Q,00:01:38;12,00:01:54;09,Sade,So describe the place where you grew up with a Tottenville.right. So I guess each of those places is so. A,00:01:57;26,00:02:04;04,F113,Sad now is that right. Feels like farm land. A,00:02:05;05,00:03:05;24,SF2,I say that it's farmland. It was nice but it's like in a country where they grew cotton. And they had the corn and the pigs and the cows. All that was there that such a move to Dublin went to Dublin in town it was like. It was nice quiet. People nice to me speak but. A lot of prejudice there. Back in my field and turbulent racial racial prejudice. And we moved to Canada Staten Island an Italian Nilesat and Staten Island and I've been here every since. And I'm 83 years old. So I couldn't send a loving caring family. It's a pleasure. Q,00:03:06;03,00:03:16;29,Auntie,Would you say one thing that makes a racial prejudice. A,00:03:18;21,00:03:35;21,F125,Yes I was I was less prejudice the racial prejudice that was like in Townsville. There was not many blacks there and there was a hatred there and that's for me is still bad but it was as bad as being down south. A,00:03:36;16,00:03:41;25,SF2,Yes but school was better. So could you describe a little. A,00:03:43;09,00:03:48;29,Auntie,Hardship having to do with those. A,00:03:49;29,00:04:04;23,SF2,Yes. Our ships there were like you when you went shopping. We didn't have much when go like back you are secondary and you can't go here and you can't go there you couldn't go there. A,00:04:05;06,00:04:08;15,F125,So places couldn't go shopping. A,00:04:08;17,00:04:31;09,M23,There's a very small town which still there was a smell that made it so hard being unprejudiced being there would you say that maybe other people would like have it. A,00:04:32;16,00:04:44;28,Auntie,So have they say. There was there found some that was just had a nasty attitude. Because of what color. The. A,00:04:45;11,00:04:53;21,F125,Black race whatever save it had the message and you go there and find the ones that was nice and pleasant. I was there for you. A,00:04:54;19,00:05:30;14,F110,And I have a loving caring family which is a blessing and Riceville and it was a pleasure of places. Even worse there was was such a certain extent they were they were prejudice here and you could see it in Townsville there and the way they act and the either the wrong that the black savey want to be bothered with us saying you're from the south and you know this that the other. A,00:05:31;02,00:05:49;22,F145,And they thought they were better but thank God our family that kept us safe. Did the right thing for our parents was there for us and that we didn't have to worry about it. The family was everything. A,00:05:50;29,00:06:01;11,M21,She does so well what we had a wonderful mother. She was a blessing. So. Q,00:06:08;24,00:06:13;08,M9,How would you say that. A,00:06:16;12,00:07:07;03,F112,Well it's changed some but like I say when I was growing up in Townsville it's not that many blacks out there now as it was was that many blacks where they are now lives but I guess it's just that there's a difference there's a difference. And in Townsville and here you know and these people are more friendly and there's more people here here than there were in the south south because it was deserted out there as you know it wasn't meant to bother me. Like I say. In. My class. I was only like. Five. Blacks in the class. A,00:07:08;02,00:07:18;16,F110,And then my uncles and my brothers class is the only black in his class so I called the Schrader's limiting my accent. A,00:07:19;15,00:07:49;20,M9,I come from a pleasant place to type now so limited there was not many blacks around the city would say that the biggest change over the difference between the South. Yes right. A,00:07:49;28,00:08:27;03,F7,Yes that's where is because the south is like I say I always say like oh you're from the country and it's not much which was all those of that but then there was that much out there for anyone like you know just in terms of like you said it was as it was it was quite empty especially at worrying about that has changed so you look at the population and what they've build there on Staten Island compared to what it was before. A,00:08:27;07,00:08:46;12,F112,It was like we thought Townsville deserved it and you come down this way. It was desert to a certain extent but I hadn't a lot. Anyway just a big difference compared today with the population of building up everything from malls stores to. Q,00:08:48;17,00:09:12;09,F129,Right. So it was. Like. Me that was that many people out there was like I could say country land. You. Know. Q,00:09:15;22,00:09:16;12,F167,What. A,00:09:17;18,00:09:39;15,F7,Oh yes there is. There are some farms like up on Highland Boulevard out that way and in that way families had farmland farmlands and that was that many. But it was like the small farmer is about that much more. A,00:09:40;14,00:09:44;28,M9,Yes. What do you think about. A,00:09:50;16,00:10:47;16,F7,The people and the scenery. It was a big that made a big difference because people coming from all different areas these different states to live here and building homes and building stories and that the population increased what it was before in every area go to what a big difference it was like you look at. Sites which country country. So it's a bit different and as you look they're coming back from Townsville to homes and that's how have know they've built up so many pleasant plains all the areas that are that way they build up the stores out and all you know and you see that we never thought it would be like that today. And as you come further down the Mall to Macy's and all that has changed all over. Q,00:10:48;22,00:10:53;06,M5,How. Yes the Thais. A,00:10:55;09,00:11:01;25,M9,Yes we are becoming a cultural yes. A,00:11:02;08,00:11:36;22,F26,So all the time you have to for both of you imagine like somebody you never know. No concept no concept of anything you're talking about given a little detail. You know it's you know like I said What did main street look like when you were growing up. Oh after shave. It was just like. A,00:11:40;21,00:11:48;09,F7,Nomads. By being country they're mainstream you had a couple of stores. A,00:11:48;16,00:12:12;27,F54,The post office precinct the drugstore and and there was there was a large what was up there and a few stores and people in an apartment before that on Main Street was on much of anything. A,00:12:14;02,00:13:04;02,F7,So like I said the movie there the drugstore that was increasing its just about all that we had they had a Altes or something there himself as a cross and white we or something like that for I was a boy wasn't that when there was still just a store for people living in stores and that wasn't that much to it. So I get built up more so much more was out there and that taught me like it was you know busy. A,00:13:04;07,00:13:15;18,F74,And I guess if you had had the stores more stores pleasure to get out. A,00:13:15;29,00:13:33;21,F7,But even though like now it's build up so much more says I've been here. But there's a big difference then now that it was you know when I moved here but out there what it was like was like an area like this that was so it. A,00:13:34;16,00:13:39;27,M5,So people do well. A,00:13:40;02,00:13:49;20,F96,Growing up my mother my father used to take the ferry to Perth Amboy job their factory jobs that they worked. A,00:13:49;25,00:14:58;09,F69,My mother worked in the garment. My father was like it was a melting or something like that factory there and they would take the ferry take the train to come down to jobs down this way but there's few jobs here on site. Now come back to bite you you try to. Keep. Up. The Sydney and I'll go to Townsville to get the jobs in Jersey to take the fair Eagle that then that had the ferry from down here to Richmond here I would go over to Jersey and they would have said they didn't have all the bridges had Outerbridge in the Vale bridge. And they built up a bridge you know and that wasn't that much in fact that factory in town they all had Neshama smelting factory there and there was very little. Where they used to go to. To. A,00:14:58;23,00:15:01;05,F101,Jersey. A,00:15:02;08,00:15:16;02,M5,So most communities said yes it is right so I used to go to I had but not that many. A,00:15:16;05,00:15:39;12,F69,SIMON HILL Yes they used the word Manhattan like I say they used to go to Jersey take the Bay Bridge. I mean they owned ferry and from Port Richmond here and. Tried to get all the states mixed up. A,00:15:41;19,00:15:51;18,F104,Impoverishment would go to China straight when you go injuriously. A,00:15:52;15,00:16:24;07,F96,Now that the NY ferry from Townsville had that Port Richmond ferry over to the second Bay was Bayonne like that you know that would be the visible things like. A,00:16:27;19,00:16:34;21,F106,Yes a little hard for someone like you. A,00:16:38;20,00:17:00;08,F7,So all my mother worked in the garment factory where they made really nice stores you know dresses coats and she would help they said you could cut some out this is digital and things like that together. A,00:17:00;10,00:17:17;02,F96,I follow them melting sorting something out of them for it and also work it out that way and that's what they did two of them did you know yes there was as many jobs to be had. A,00:17:17;15,00:17:20;28,M9,Yes. So as you said. Q,00:17:29;04,00:17:41;09,F106,Yes. So what what does your family now. So what did you do. So the jobs have changed so. A,00:17:42;20,00:18:46;07,F54,I worked. When I graduated high I worked in an Church in New Jersey for Westinghouse. Used to go to make air conditioners and television. Word comment factory like that. And like I said before there were other in the garment factory. And so I used to take hairdryers survived with a and from Titusville to pick me up and go to my church and ask when we go to Westinghouse Westinghouse attach images. And that's the way. My brother worked in Union New Jersey. And he was a. A,00:18:50;24,00:19:24;07,F107,Factory making making tools. That's what he did. You were there were making tools and things like that. He advanced his position. And that's why he made what with you do it. But my sister she worked at a garment factory with my mother. She worked there for a while and see when she got married that was you know I was just about it. Yes. A,00:19:26;22,00:19:48;19,F108,So the people in my family now have of the oldest one which is b b pricing. Oh and nephew. A,00:19:50;08,00:19:54;18,F107,He's the oldest one. He's worked for the Board of Education. A,00:19:55;24,00:20:12;06,F58,And my niece she's a professor in Brook college and my nephew. A,00:20:12;16,00:20:16;26,F107,He was a teacher.

He's a manager there and they go with us when he's retired from the sanitation. A,00:21:08;02,00:21:22;16,F111,Said my niece.

You're asking how does that sound like I would ask about the progress. Trying to hold back the very first mother. A,00:22:53;17,00:23:40;07,F108,Yeah. So. I think over the years fantastic jobs has said they made in their lifetime and so like I say my oldest nephew before he retired thing where he advanced he was in this fashion. A,00:23:44;09,00:23:49;16,F116,And he became a supervisor.

She's going to Duke University and they are dying and she's doing fantastic job there driving. A,00:25:50;22,00:26:07;03,F118,Coming here were any loving and caring about her. Well she's doing a fantastic job for education and concerned and being a nice polite young lady and we are blessed for that. A,00:26:07;06,00:26:19;13,M22,And our sister Jade in Deseret they're going to school and then had their twins and they're in sports and they're doing a fantastic job. A,00:26:19;19,00:26:53;05,F120,Like her sister when she was in high school she was involved in the soccer ball across the hall and there just like her and they're doing a fantastic job.

I'm so happy and proud of the family. I mean truly blessed. So back. Q,00:27:44;15,00:27:48;15,M23,To you. Could you describe. A,00:27:52;09,00:28:14;08,M6,What you have got to talk about. No it's just about like I said I haven't been down to rise Silva spent a time there. A,00:28:15;14,00:28:19;03,F118,Years. One time I was one back. A,00:28:19;29,00:28:38;06,F112,That's in the family and you go back to the funeral. Know be there for a couple days. And Riceville a very small town like I say if I could by coming in a light emitting light going out as I was a child and this very small town and I. A,00:28:40;14,00:29:10;06,F118,And I haven't been there nine years. The last time I kind say I was there is I think a chance to to see anything but you wonder whether that was where I lived. Was that a country until I moved to Dublin. A,00:29:10;06,00:29:45;23,F121,There was this country highway that very little traffic in Riceville there very little traffic and like I say that was just like I can tell you everything around your house like the houses but you see they didn't have any lights. It was on a farm. That was a rice field and you had the kerosene lamps you had to expand that from the farm. A,00:29:46;04,00:30:06;09,F123,You had installed stoves and I say it's just it was comfortable we are comfortable. A,00:30:06;09,00:30:27;24,F121,That's why it was in that day. This is the text panels where you kept the pigs the pigs on the farm. But what you would do with the pigs pen is bring them in the pig the pigs. When you plan to kill them so they will get fat. A,00:30:27;27,00:31:00;12,F118,You see them feed them see them. They will get sad because out on a farm there is really not doing anything. They're not just in the pen they keep eating and so they get fat. The new Reggie kill them they will eat the pig. And that's why you would have the pigs and I have had that with Sarah from all the world there were cane make the syrup from the farm. A,00:31:01;15,00:31:10;28,F124,And then you have your own corn then they have their own cotton cotton for the flowers. A,00:31:10;29,00:31:16;17,M21,No Should made the flowers and things out of things. A,00:31:16;29,00:31:19;23,F112,Oh I hope so. A,00:31:19;29,00:31:23;10,M9,Yes. Right. A,00:31:24;04,00:32:01;16,F118,You make the sugar cane you take it at a mill like a grinder. You bring in there and you feed that into the ground and a squeeze the juice out in this container. Then they had this large huge tub. Like. A. Big tub they would put that in all the juice from the cave and you know how to cook it you make a fire under that of which are troubles elevated on some breaks. You put the juice cane in that. A,00:32:01;29,00:32:21;25,F96,So and yet you cook it down and so you've made the syrup. That's right you could take several syrup. You had enough for your home and things like that. Then they had the cotton farm cotton whenever cotton on the farm. A,00:32:22;07,00:32:43;27,F76,They will you picked the cotton you take it into the mill and I take the seeds out of the garden and then they would take that and they make make matches and make quilts they make all that either of them would get the seeds in there. A,00:32:44;16,00:33:36;22,F96,And they said they would patch that get the material out to get material so it together like you see like you see a patch quilt today. That's what this looks like like that. So what does. It sends out more here. Because I grew up here I I was young when I came here it blew up when you had more than you had there was rice fields a beautiful quiet little country town very very nice. A,00:33:36;29,00:34:51;14,F118,And like I say I can't say that much about it much nicer it naturally it's still a quiet town because I went down for the funeral and things like that. But it's it's it's it's. It's a quiet place but I said no to. Because there's more here more to do for people you know and more advantages are there than there because what that was found there that you could do because there was factories here and you don't have the factories and things like so was the transition from it was just the idea of getting used to how people would treat you. You know. They had the attitudes to be nasty instead of being friendly and nice and here for each other. Q,00:34:53;04,00:34:57;04,M21,People was it's it's it's of them are just like you know. A,00:34:58;05,00:35:17;22,F120,But you felt more down south because there was more prejudice and they are no prejudice no one as bad as on as bad as the South because. A,00:35:18;05,00:37:32;06,F76,Because there was war people lost. You dealt with more people. That's what made it. Yes yes. Do you think. It would make you sad and disgusted because. It was taught to do the right thing and be polite and be there for each other. Because of who what are and how when you see them when they're being prejudiced or being nasty. And even I have said why are against the black masses of black against the whiteness of blacks against the black Lassie is just why some people are. And it's hard to see how people could be so nasty when you've been nice and polite to them. And why can't they treat you the same way as you treat them. There's no need no reason for that. Why. Well I want to be like that. Life is too short. You are blessed. God have you on Earth. And you are blessed to be here to share this with us of a cowboy or a race or what have you. We don't need that here for each other means thankful and letting. God know that people know how much we appreciate everyday and that's what counts. Now that said so still today you see people still being nasty. I won't care what race what about where some people are just nasty. Nasty among their own race that their hair color and everything is just me. Some people just have problems. A,00:37:35;02,00:38:10;29,F127,Pray and help them that's all we can do. So. You're just. Of. That house. I save up to. Use. Of. A,00:38:12;19,00:38:44;07,F119,Pepper time with the shot. Take the ferry going to pretend to shop and go to church stores nicer nice stores. Walk up Smith Street and then do your shopping. Now that was nice. It was a pleasure to get out and go into that. You know. Gas. And. Be among the people. And people are pretty way of saying Which church people do things like that are nice. They. A,00:38:48;02,00:39:03;24,M25,Just said they were so registers. Oh yes was an impression which is this is very new york you know what. A,00:39:05;14,00:39:13;22,F76,About the South. Yes. So it was was nice that way and news treated that way. You know. A,00:39:15;22,00:39:59;26,F114,The I have pledged to go over there and get more smiles. How are you. You know I say go going to church and doing your shopping except for food shopping the clothing shopping and that was everything. You know so many nicer that way to get. Out. Of. What neighbors like. Well. My neighbors there was like. I. Said wheat. A,00:40:01;16,00:40:06;00,F76,And Rice there was I was out there in the country you know. A,00:40:06;00,00:40:18;18,F129,So it was a minute wasn't it. No that wasn't close down way down. You could see a house over there somewhere away. You know it wasn't like the farm. A,00:40:19;19,00:40:32;29,F130,And then we moved into town after we left the country and every town where there was a houses was closer that some of the people just just don't want to be bothered. A,00:40:34;00,00:40:45;24,F127,And they just had attitudes. Yes we the black people yes on the black neighborhood. I don't see. A,00:40:49;06,00:40:50;16,F131,The black people that live there. A,00:40:52;07,00:40:59;18,F128,No I don't remove them or remove them at all. I really wasn't a refugee left right field. A,00:41:01;08,00:41:08;13,F109,And went to double. Said we stay there. My mother came up and I. Thought I was up. They. Were. A,00:41:12;19,00:42:07;16,F132,Black and but they there wasn't the throngs of people. It wasn't that easy even going to school there and. Things like that. It was just something that just wasn't friendly. So long as we kept ourselves. And. You know you try to get involved you want to be friendly you want to be nice. Some people just don't appreciate that. And know how to be nice. And do the right thing you know. My mother always told my parents. All my past mother father grandparents tells you do the right thing you don't have to worry. And. See that's what we always have couldn't do right. We just evolved. We just involved mothers kept self cause you don't do the wrong thing. And that's what that's the way we. A,00:42:08;17,00:42:17;04,F133,Would break my mother's heart. A,00:42:17;06,00:42:47;29,F132,You will go to jail or something like that. The main thing you heard in your family was when you're doing they are there for you and they're doing the best they can and everything and you go out and do the wrong thing. Why would you want to go out there and do the wrong thing. With so many children. Have parents that didn't care. And you can see why they got involved in the wrong things. Because the press wasn't there for. Q,00:42:48;03,00:42:52;02,M27,So how would you describe your name. A,00:42:54;22,00:43:11;20,F128,Like I say arranged with all the Townsville I've got to say Georgia those people there wasn't a friend. Q,00:43:14;12,00:43:15;09,F132,So. So. A,00:43:25;07,00:44:17;18,F135,There was wise there was there was apartment house that we know the first visit a little little place. So my mother found the stuff I was our apartment house. And. Even the ones it's all black in the apartments but there wasn't that it wasn't that friendly. And that's why more or less and there was some some blacks up the street there in the nice home. And there wasn't a friend or Lauzon was saying that they are oh you're from the south. A,00:44:21;13,00:44:26;08,F137,And you don't you know I was I was too good. A,00:44:27;02,00:44:31;02,F128,I just had turned 12 when I moved here from Georgia. A,00:44:35;18,00:44:38;24,F132,Yes I can say they don't want to be bothered. A,00:44:38;25,00:44:47;29,F135,WALLACE But you're from Georgia you don't know this Latin the other. A,00:44:47;29,00:44:50;10,M28,You're right. A,00:44:51;05,00:44:59;02,F135,Yes. And so is this that's why we more or less. To ourselves. You know. A,00:45:00;23,00:46:54;02,F128,I have a sister ship. She's five years old. And then when she like I say I'm graduated and went to her mother and she met some people and that's how she was she met a system that was working there and that's how she met her husband there where they live. To assist it's not that way that way South Jersey people more. It wasn't that much but it did go out as we got older we saw go into dances. Down at St. George that had the name of the place and Cromwell center. Center. You say about it which is going the right way to go down like this once a month then bam twice a month they would have dances there and like my sense of divide which has got to be our in-laws to come over and she said boy what the brother in law and she got together as a comment over two dances. Then my son went to George's dances. So I had to stop meddling that way. And my brother was into sports. And. He got involved that way. And so. I was just as all of us as friends. One is how I met them. Yes dances. And they had. You said Count Basie. A,00:46:54;27,00:47:00;06,F136,Dizzy Gillespie which has a name. A,00:47:01;22,00:48:48;26,F128,There's used to be over here the big large names I'm trying to think it is. And then they had the local bands over here like Eric just said. And I don't know. Now we play with Count Basie they always be down from us. Yes. So either I have a little local parties where I was there during that time there the live bands and that was a thing there faster than ever that dancing had to go out and have a friendship. You meet different people. You dance and have fun. You say you. Is the fuel that was that was not that many not that many because I can say those things and all they didn't involve other families and all that bother you know and see me go my sister. And. She didn't invite her in-laws or just say which was surely they hadn't gotten married yet. They would come out as a band. The dance is over. And we all need to get together a couple who because up and take us around them. A lot of fun that way you know and down at mission. That they had the bands of lay. A,00:48:49;29,00:50:04;24,F85,Down on them. What touched down on. Richmond cherish and. Be a club in the name. No he wasn't always like on the opposite side of the border. They were that place over there. Know how we go to have deficits down there. But man fans come here to the fans on it. I can't think of it from Wilson. So from what I said I can't think of the name of the other place. But they used to have a. Guy's name bands there. And so like I said I'd get to base it although it was really good at that time I got friendly with him and introduced a friend of mine that played with Count Basie from a friend of mine she's in New Jersey. And. A,00:50:06;11,00:50:23;15,F138,That's nice too. So let's have some fun the dances Nafez. That. Is. A,00:50:26;00,00:50:39;27,F85,Because it is in the south it was precious and all I want to read it is still have the black in the whiteness said now. I like that they were very few white and the blacks and very few blacks in the way. A,00:50:40;16,00:50:53;04,M20,So that's why it was like. We. A,00:50:53;26,00:51:08;09,F85,Were like swing you know like that place as you know you want to play that swing for the dance right. Oh it always has. A,00:51:08;10,00:51:35;10,M9,You're always just very nice to also out when they come dressed to go. But with all this as 5 per cent boy crowd Smith Street not too far from the ferry we still go there and there's a lot of shopping there and there was. I can't find a name is two of them. A,00:51:36;13,00:52:24;12,F140,Civilians. We used to do the main thing and get our shooting civilians and nice expensive shoes just to have a missable then get. We like the shoes in the store was just this just for dancing. We were well you know the thing is the mother wanted to dance next week. I had them I just want to dance it was almost issue like that. You know. It. Wasn't. A,00:52:25;18,00:52:45;20,F142,It wasn't that. Once in a while they have a house party. Out of the lines. All depends on who's having it. Because like some people you didn't deal with because there was drinking and nasty carrying on so you just involved with them. A,00:52:45;20,00:53:24;16,F144,You know I didn't know what it was like those afraid of them like knives and things like that. You hear this on this. Oh no you don't do that. You know. So you go through that. So. It's to be like I said quite a few housewives but it. All depends on who's having them. Because you know. A,00:53:26;14,00:53:32;21,F142,You just don't do those things. You never let them be involved in those type of people. We never did. Q,00:53:32;24,00:53:35;22,F143,You don't do that. So it's. A,00:53:45;22,00:54:03;20,F142,Really stick out. This. Family being there for family. We used to go to Philly that feel out to visit my mother's sisters. She said she was all of them. A,00:54:03;21,00:54:42;29,F146,She had two sisters there and she going still be there. You got to visit them and they used come to visit. Me and I said. It. Is the bond of family visits. You know. I mean everything in the world. So. I. Had a loving caring child. Because.

So during the trial of another telephone the telephone. We got the news monopole. But still that it was right all the time. Every time I was writing letters. You know. So that's the way it was. We had the bond with the family that was. A,00:55:10;19,00:55:50;28,F148,With everything in the world. So. Because. That's when. The. From. What. Would. You say about. Her. Yet right because. You know. We didn't deal with the ones that was causing the trouble. Whether it was black or white on rice what race. A,00:55:52;10,00:56:09;21,F149,We had white friends that was so nice. We had. Very few the black ones because it was many around. But we did nice things was there for family. We had a bond together. We did live here. They are like I say you couldn't be here. A,00:56:10;21,00:56:19;16,F150,And I was involved in sports and school and I guess my brother my sister she wasn't that much in the sport she was a sports person. A,00:56:19;19,00:56:44;09,F15,What was involved with the nicer people doing the nicer things and we always will be proud. And made our family proud and they was there for us at all times best that way you know especially my mother she was always anchor care what it was or what she was right there at all. Q,00:56:45;13,00:56:56;26,M19,What did you oh so ready. A,00:56:56;27,00:57:37;29,F151,I was more like a quiet like happy quiet person.

Back in those days. No other pants. We had our dresses used to make us some. And she bought it. And she made sure that we had and my brother had. Q,00:57:38;26,00:57:43;11,F9,So she was there on what it was or what she was there. A,00:57:43;21,00:57:56;22,F151,She would deprive herself of things so she could have it there for us. She was always there for us. And that's the way it went. Bust. A,00:58:01;25,00:58:31;23,F99,Oh they used to wear used to wear the pageboy boys come down on a and then they say have this some white knight that pushed up the pageboy wasted.

Then I used curling on held the curl it and then I would have the rose of a cold night set my alarm early I was spinning maybe about half 45 mins certain days and I just had to just braid it small and then take that long. And by curl that would take me maybe that. A,00:59:37;14,00:59:42;08,F78,Maybe 45 minutes. I wrote that us. A,00:59:44;28,00:59:51;04,F10,To make it easier. So what is the speed at. A,00:59:55;23,01:00:04;00,F153,Skeezer. A,01:00:09;02,01:00:10;25,F63,You know you're the Coleby and yeah right. A,01:00:10;25,01:00:51;22,F10,I mean that he is about to cutting early and short they weighed this way.

You don't know I love you so much she's been a friend but not a close close. A,01:08:26;18,01:08:45;04,F151,And I was surprised at her saying something like that. Was that what I could get him out to dances and things. Come on that day and I called him everyday. You're going to get him out of the house. You know. It wasn't even your brother in law. With. A,01:08:45;12,01:08:57;24,F9,Me.

She's in she's got friends with her at work. But. They were so envious of me getting this job being the first female. A,01:09:50;21,01:11:00;19,F33,And being black all the black and white was in tears. So they accused me of so many things and then it was nasty to me. But I just kept my head up and smile and get right inside out of Westinghouse she made airconditioners and I had like a at assembly line I worked on the assembly line. And that I finally got. Promotion. And they used to do the wiring and the soldering the things they used to do there and I got promotion I had like 150 people on the line. And I was responsible for them to do the job right. And to get the production of that on time. And people was envious. Of me getting it. Even in management there was interviews. But I had a wonderful supervisor. He's originally from Virginia. A,01:11:02;12,01:11:30;04,F34,And also he was he was the first black in management. And he's from Virginia. He had a real southern accent and he asks me about becoming a supervisor and his daughter had kidney failure. He found that my sister grandmother had. Kidney failure. A,01:11:30;28,01:11:40;15,F33,And he used to go in and call me and ask for a meeting. And we sit down we talk about. His condition and his daughter's condition. A,01:11:41;02,01:11:47;20,F34,And would that be very close. And they are saying are you going with him working with him. A,01:11:47;20,01:11:57;12,F135,We talked about his fight about my sister's condition because his daughter was having the same problem. And it was getting worse and worse. A,01:11:57;12,01:12:08;27,F34,That's just like my sisters had that way and they were saying I was going with him. So I said well until the day we are still good friends. But. A,01:12:10;11,01:12:16;08,F33,White black and spanish Puerto Ricans and I was so so was so nasty and envious. A,01:12:16;08,01:12:20;20,F35,So I used to walk back down looked straight ahead Hello smile on I. A,01:12:20;21,01:12:25;28,F9,It was the one to speak otherwise I just kept walking. A,01:12:26;03,01:12:32;14,M29,So I retired. A,01:12:35;13,01:12:36;15,M28,Yes. And was. A,01:12:38;19,01:12:46;16,F35,I guess a hell of a lot because you know like I was there for him to help him with the daughter's condition. A,01:12:46;27,01:12:54;05,F137,You're right. I could comfort him and be there for him. Because when she first started out. A,01:12:56;25,01:12:58;29,F161,He couldn't believe it. And then. A,01:13:01;20,01:13:12;06,F9,We started talking and that and I told him about my sister and that that was so close you know. A,01:13:15;14,01:13:19;15,F33,Yes. And I got a sense it's a day. We're still friends. A,01:13:20;25,01:13:35;06,F9,I talk to him about three weeks ago now.

After she passed. He knew. A,01:13:48;04,01:14:09;29,F9,She had a kidney failure and she built of her own rejection. And that was it. So that's how we get we say so close. It was never age. You know you hit this because you. A,01:14:10;19,01:14:16;02,SF2,Know I have to give a shot something to it. What is this is walking. A,01:14:18;22,01:14:34;14,F49,Thinking like 300 about 300 plus. It's like it's one day over there. Q,01:14:34;14,01:14:41;26,F162,Why. A,01:14:43;19,01:14:47;29,F63,I'll let myself go. I love you. Q,01:14:49;10,01:14:54;08,F3,OK. You think about where you want your life to be. Q,01:14:57;03,01:15:09;02,M33,So the next question is how would you describe a perfect day when you were young. Perfect day when you're young and this happens at home. A,01:15:09;19,01:15:14;07,F90,That everything went well. Home friends and all. A,01:15:15;14,01:15:29;07,M33,So say you're in this scenario. Like when you were a little girl were teenager what. What are some things that you might. Think. That story is pretty good too. A,01:15:32;18,01:15:40;28,F80,Hanging out with family and go shopping. That was a perfect day. That was the family. The family was shopping and purchased. A,01:15:42;05,01:16:01;14,F71,Things that the family wanted. So why is this happening for them. If you think your life would be like. A,01:16:07;13,01:16:16;04,F78,Yes I plan my life to be different. I was going to get married and have. Four children. But due to having surgery young. A,01:16:21;04,01:16:37;27,F87,My friends I was engaged. That's. Why. They wanted children and I and. Want to say good now children so I just broke the engagement. So I think when they have a family. A,01:16:39;14,01:16:52;03,F80,And they want to talk about children my sister and talk about children and my rather than talk about you like I did I was going to have to into two girls and two boys. You talked about. Q,01:16:55;12,01:16:59;25,F71,Procedure that they had the surgery. A,01:17:00;03,01:17:08;19,F163,I wonder why I had. I had. Started out I had when I got my monthly period. A,01:17:09;13,01:18:36;22,F87,I started getting cramps my somebody hurt me so bad. And I went to Dr.. And they told me I had to sit on my ovary in a tube on the womb and I had to take it medicine and this. It told me I had to have this hysterectomy. I told the doctor just let me try to have at least one child. They said no you can't. Get condition you can't. I thought I'll go out of my mind. And that's what I've wanted to do. I had to go along with it. My. Brother came to the hospital that night. Twelve o'clock at night trying to console me and the family trying to console. We came back 12 o'clock that night. I had to have it because I had. A cyst and a tumor and all that and then I have so many operations up to that full operation that. So that's why I'm. Deprived of not having children. So I guess it wasn't meant to be friends she said and fiance. They like to talk about shoes. And I couldn't. A,01:18:38;22,01:18:52;08,F164,Tell them I couldn't have been Bob so I never did. And you say it's is it's fulfilled. A,01:18:52;09,01:19:31;23,F80,Thank god I have. I was here for my mother. She passed my sister's children and my brother's children in a different way. Because for me like I say God makes no mistakes and. With my sister passing young. And. Being have a family. And like I said my brother in law. Having. My. A,01:19:34;26,01:19:52;12,F87,Helping the family. You can't couldn't be all the family that said Thank God like us he was just to pass and help the children. If the children have been raised the children as I can say God makes no mistakes. A,01:19:52;16,01:19:56;13,M18,That's what you do. A,01:19:56;26,01:20:11;12,F78,You don't know I don't dwell on because it was her passing as it is here I La Raza. I can say Stephanie was just six when she passed. A,01:20:12;14,01:20:31;18,F90,And I helped him raise them with him being depressed and everything. So what could I do. Try to be supportive of it and that's what. Caused me to do this. I would say well why take her and have me. A,01:20:32;19,01:20:41;23,F77,With you on. Oh and I. Want it. A,01:20:45;28,01:20:53;02,F78,It just broke my heart the thoughts of that. And I said Well like you say God no means makes no mistakes. He. A,01:20:54;15,01:20:57;15,F163,Helped out so I. A,01:20:57;28,01:21:09;21,F90,His reasoning. I can't question God. You know I left it at that. A,01:21:09;21,01:21:36;12,M18,So we talked a little about memories. But do you have any childhood memories bad or do that just the down. I. Mean the best things that happened to you. How old were you when you had to get this. No I was I was I was I was. Q,01:21:39;09,01:22:09;02,F90,21. The same goes for anyone who is such suffering. I've got my period so I'm having my period. I guess after a couple of months I start getting cramps. And that's why I live it as I got older. Do you think your case cases so deal with. A,01:22:09;16,01:22:28;02,M18,That. I don't know because they try give different medication. And I. Had a. Sits on the ovary. A,01:22:28;16,01:22:44;20,F87,And a tour on the home before they did the hysterectomy. Then they told me that the. Had to do this directive. And that's why I said let me just try. And they said no you can't. A,01:22:45;22,01:23:00;06,M13,Do that. So I'm sure I would have that will lead into something else and it's something I forgot what it was. Is I would never have been able to have shielded. A,01:23:11;27,01:23:23;10,F17,Against Mississippi did best for the family I'm here for each other and doing the best I can. A,01:23:23;22,01:23:42;26,F158,And the shopping like I'm doing now is going out of place. Some people don't know what a pleasure that is. And I said God is so good. He makes no mistakes. And supposed to go out which is all the time each and every time. A,01:23:43;05,01:24:10;15,F27,I mean everything in the world for me. What is your town. That good games. Play. A,01:24:12;24,01:24:49;27,F158,Play play. You know why don't you cover the thousands. Well you know I thought when of the day and I know it says I did. I didn't play that well with his friends because I didn't have any friends. I'd say why they didn't want it bothers me because we just so the family in town. No there wasn't anybody there in school that was really around to be friends with. A,01:24:49;29,01:25:11;19,F63,So it was more of this family as we just playing and hopscotch and jump rope and things like that. That's what we did is we did for see I forgot all about them. A,01:25:12;02,01:25:19;25,F23,I got to play cards. Now I'm so sick and all that I forgot all about ever what we did. A,01:25:24;16,01:25:51;28,M35,Did you play with anything like song that went down in Ohio. Jump rope. I'm saying that song like double dutch you know singing so that's like you say I've been around the world. But yeah you play that man that and. A,01:25:52;02,01:25:55;10,F34,Like I say it's hard to say. A,01:25:57;02,01:26:19;15,F158,When you're a that's like you alone and I did I didn't regret it because the South was not around to be friendly with you to be nice with and that was just that's just the way it was. So but. It is blessed that they had us that was a loving caring family which meant everything. A,01:26:19;29,01:26:25;07,F11,You know. That's what it meant. A,01:26:27;28,01:26:36;06,F5,Also with my dolls I little the dolls changing their clothes and their hair and all that. A,01:26:36;14,01:27:11;04,M35,You know that's what I'm thinking that the dolls represent the young black. Why would you say this is all of all white dolls. A,01:27:11;12,01:27:34;17,F158,It was a pleasure because you didn't have them. And that's what you're saying. So that's what we play with. Yeah. And that's what we play with. It was a pleasure that I had the dolls that play with you know as my main thing. Now all home made you. A,01:27:36;25,01:27:47;11,F166,Know what Mother Mother would buy the toys and the toys. Like I said toys that we play. You know that was like. A,01:27:49;08,01:27:53;06,M36,When you or your mother like. A,01:27:55;13,01:28:05;09,F12,Yes it makes sense because of your best father. A,01:28:05;13,01:28:42;14,F94,I made the matching outfits.

Just a few just a few. A,01:29:53;06,01:29:57;13,F23,You see what the radio said about this and really I didn't see very much. A,01:30:00;03,01:30:15;21,F103,This album is so so so so much. So I was like OK mother didn't like that much. A,01:30:18;21,01:30:30;14,F158,Followed here sit there on the news hegemonism stuff like his room there in the kitchen now what have you you know. A,01:30:30;15,01:30:42;28,F37,So it involves a mother should know was this the right tone. A,01:30:48;12,01:30:54;19,F156,No it mother told us that those stories in this story. C,01:30:55;07,01:30:57;06,F12,Right. Right. A,01:30:58;21,01:31:07;16,M2,Know what she says fairytales that's all. A,01:31:07;23,01:31:39;23,F12,I just it. No no I got so much. Get so. Tradition making. A,01:31:41;21,01:31:45;29,F3,I said I just live the the dog was not used. A,01:31:46;09,01:31:58;05,F94,So my own clothes as near as I grow up I used it so that way you know and things like that I used to do. Yeah. Thank you so much. A,01:31:58;06,01:32:20;19,F31,So now loving and caring for each other. Doing the best you can by all. A,01:32:21;09,01:32:32;22,F17,And not hurting anyone's feelings. There's a misunderstanding you can resolve it by talking and without giving a nasty attitude and being very. C,01:32:41;04,01:32:44;08,M2,Right no matter what. A,01:32:44;08,01:32:51;24,F63,Call me a light water. You're here for each other and to do the right thing. Somebody made a mistake. A,01:32:51;27,01:33:17;12,M2,Listen to them and helped to resolve it and be there for them and that's what the most because it describes was means for us like you describe exactly right. A,01:33:26;17,01:34:04;05,F158,Everything you name it. I got to say it's unexplainable because you show it. You let them know that you're there for them. And because of what it is or how. It's just hard to put into. Other words that I'm not the person that you love me and don't just say it you mean it from the heart. It means for me your heart. It sure is from now. And you can't love because it's from the heart. A,01:34:04;07,01:34:12;15,F12,You can't buy it. Sense is priceless right. Right. A,01:34:12;15,01:34:27;29,F166,More important it is let's say you can buy it was more important than you know loving and caring. If you don't have a penny for them which you loving and Care Express. A,01:34:35;22,01:34:40;02,F88,Talk about it. I shall try to get the family and all know. A,01:34:40;20,01:34:46;29,F78,How I love and care for them. And I'm here for them. You know everything I can do. A,01:34:48;28,01:35:02;21,F158,For them. Daza how small or how large or what if it's just a kind word that I'm here for them to say just to go out and get something I can get a gift for them. A,01:35:02;23,01:35:26;23,F17,That's why I was singing like that because that's what it means to me onco care what you have. You can't say good thing with you when you leave. And check out and go to another world. Put your shoulder to love and care while you're with them. So when they say actions speak louder than words comes. A,01:35:34;22,01:35:38;25,F63,Yes. At times it all depends on what it is. A,01:35:39;22,01:36:14;29,F3,But it's also right to write that the you know self love like you being selfish in other words no selfish love that were into no no. A,01:36:14;29,01:36:27;16,F158,Because you know why if you did said that self love you just said by yourself you just there in the world of your own and didn't do the rest. A,01:36:27;29,01:36:42;22,F154,Well I don't mean like loving yourself as lovely as ever. No I mean like loving everyone. Loving yourself and loving everyone. Else as much as you love it. A,01:36:42;24,01:37:05;23,F169,So I believe in loving them more of myself because they are here for you and you are here for them in this show your love that means everything in the world if you don't show that you love and care. A,01:37:06;17,01:37:16;21,F53,It's a sad thing just as being a selfish person. And what it will do for yourself you're just there alone. A,01:37:17;08,01:37:39;24,F3,Yes. So like you said. You know when. You said people don't. Think your. Culture people don't think you deserve it. Q,01:37:41;19,01:37:45;18,M37,But how do you think it's important. A,01:37:47;28,01:38:17;16,F53,Yes because you're right. Right. That way you accept this because this is me and I'm proud of me and then saying your love and you care for yourself that part that you say don't put yourself down because of anybody else you love you care for yourself. And then as fighting show the loving care for someone else but just you could just be me. You don't not amount to anything. A,01:38:17;29,01:38:40;10,M36,So you feel like if you can't accept you can't you can't accept it. Right. Right. Same thing so loving yourself other people that way. Right. So is it fair to care for some of the people. Q,01:38:40;14,01:38:51;05,F157,How do you practice. So can like for us. A,01:38:56;07,01:39:08;11,F53,I have pride in what I want and what I want to do and I want to see good results. Then I'll go and take care of these things. Do these things get the good results. A,01:39:08;14,01:39:38;18,F94,That my look what I did look like accomplished to get this get this far and to get what I want. That's what makes me feel good that way. Than that think there's any other way. Like I said I did this because of I'm so proud I want to look at this love for me. You know. That's what makes me feel proud that way. Q,01:39:38;18,01:39:39;29,F3,Was it difficult. A,01:39:41;02,01:40:00;19,M37,Yes. Was it difficult before. Yes. A,01:40:00;23,01:40:14;20,F5,No. Because you know why. I know me and I know how I am because of what who I am what race I have where I come from. A,01:40:14;23,01:41:14;06,F63,I have the pride and I want to move forward because of what is or isn't. And I would never let myself down to lower myself to something like that. Because whatever whoever however I'm doing the right thing and that's what counts. Oh yes right. Like I say if I make any mistakes help me please help me forgive me and turn me around. Yes. And have they given for the mistakes I've made. And every night I tell them that they give me and I'm not I'm aware of mom as they showed me and helped me and turned me around. Q,01:41:14;07,01:41:48;23,M2,How do you teach people that you love them so how do you teach them how to accept them. How do you teach them when they are eyes tried to reach out. Tell them regardless of what when who you are Glorioso keep yourself up with pride. Because. A,01:41:49;04,01:42:24;02,F63,You are the most important person there is because if you going to lower yourself who will go on the help you if you don't you're going down yourself all the time but have your pride and keep yourself look up regards to make mistakes turn around to correct your mistake and then that's why you keep moving you. A,01:42:28;17,01:42:38;27,F5,Yes so let them know. What if you don't he is going to be down. And down have down always have the pride. A,01:42:40;12,01:43:03;07,F17,And do the right thing until you are proven wrong when you're proven wrong. He's OK you're correct the mistake I made. And don't keep saying that. OK then. No I didn't make the mistake. But. Until you are proven wrong. Keep your pride up and do the right thing. And if you are proven wrong. Oh I didn't realize you're right. A,01:43:03;10,01:43:11;16,M2,I made a mistake that up the good work in helping me. A,01:43:14;16,01:43:19;17,F53,You learn you learn from the mistakes all of that. A,01:43:19;19,01:43:41;29,F63,I know that you learn from the mistakes because until then you're always right. Oh yes I didn't realize that was that wasn't right. I made a mistake there. Like I said you said God please forgive me and whoever the person was forgive me for the mistake I made. You know I didn't realize at the time and I made a mistake. A,01:43:42;22,01:43:45;16,F16,Yeah they have mercy upon us. A,01:43:45;17,01:43:48;03,F18,That's what we have to do. C,01:43:51;22,01:43:55;09,M37,Oh yes. A,01:43:57;02,01:44:25;12,F63,I have faith in God and faith in myself and I put faith in people up until they let me down.

Out of all hurt harm or danger on and doing the right thing by all means forgive us for us. A,01:44:25;29,01:44:31;14,F169,And I mean that from my father my every day of my life. A,01:44:36;28,01:44:55;02,F6,Yes. All right. Do you think the faith that you have in other people is something that you just automatically have until they prove you're wrong. Or do you think it's something that. They have to. A,01:44:58;02,01:45:04;29,F4,Like they have to yes. A,01:45:05;13,01:45:30;22,F5,I see I have faith in them and until they're proven wrong because of how can I not have faith because doubting that people have the faith in them prove it wrong.
