Erlene Curry. 
My birthday is May 27.  I was born 1934.  I was born in Wightsville, Georgia. 
My mother is Bernice Curry.  My father was Sam Reese. But they wasn't together; they separated. 
I had a wonderful mother.  The stepfather he was nice.
Wonderful with my&nbsp;my mother. My father was on the  quiet side. And that wasnt, he didn't talk that much.  He was there.  
 So yes yes father stepfather. 
So are you my real biological father right. 
I grew up in Staten Island. I was born in Georgia. I was born in Wrightsville Georgia say they move. 
Now to Dublin Georgia and I came here when I was 10 years or came to Staten Island when I was 10 years old. 
Sad now is that right. Feels like farm land. 
I say that it's farmland. It was nice but it's like in a country where they grew cotton. And they had the corn and the pigs and the cows. All that was there that such a move to Dublin went to Dublin in town it was like. It was nice quiet. People nice to me speak but. A lot of prejudice there. Back in my field and turbulent racial racial prejudice. And we moved to Canada Staten Island an Italian Nilesat and Staten Island and I've been here every since. And I'm 83 years old. So I couldn't send a loving caring family. It's a pleasure. 
Yes I was I was less prejudice the racial prejudice that was like in Townsville. There was not many blacks there and there was a hatred there and that's for me is still bad but it was as bad as being down south. 
Yes but school was better. So could you describe a little. 
Hardship having to do with those. 
Yes. Our ships there were like you when you went shopping. We didn't have much when go like back you are secondary and you can't go here and you can't go there you couldn't go there. 
So places couldn't go shopping. 
There's a very small town which still there was a smell that made it so hard being unprejudiced being there would you say that maybe other people would like have it. 
So have they say. There was there found some that was just had a nasty attitude. Because of what color. The. 
Black race whatever save it had the message and you go there and find the ones that was nice and pleasant. I was there for you. 
And I have a loving caring family which is a blessing and Riceville and it was a pleasure of places. Even worse there was was such a certain extent they were they were prejudice here and you could see it in Townsville there and the way they act and the either the wrong that the black savey want to be bothered with us saying you're from the south and you know this that the other. 
And they thought they were better but thank God our family that kept us safe. Did the right thing for our parents was there for us and that we didn't have to worry about it. The family was everything. 
She does so well what we had a wonderful mother. She was a blessing. So. 
Well it's changed some but like I say when I was growing up in Townsville it's not that many blacks out there now as it was was that many blacks where they are now lives but I guess it's just that there's a difference there's a difference. And in Townsville and here you know and these people are more friendly and there's more people here here than there were in the south south because it was deserted out there as you know it wasn't meant to bother me. Like I say. In. My class. I was only like. Five. Blacks in the class. 
And then my uncles and my brothers class is the only black in his class so I called the Schrader's limiting my accent. 
I come from a pleasant place to type now so limited there was not many blacks around the city would say that the biggest change over the difference between the South. Yes right. 
Yes that's where is because the south is like I say I always say like oh you're from the country and it's not much which was all those of that but then there was that much out there for anyone like you know just in terms of like you said it was as it was it was quite empty especially at worrying about that has changed so you look at the population and what they've build there on Staten Island compared to what it was before. 
It was like we thought Townsville deserved it and you come down this way. It was desert to a certain extent but I hadn't a lot. Anyway just a big difference compared today with the population of building up everything from malls stores to. 
Oh yes there is. There are some farms like up on Highland Boulevard out that way and in that way families had farmland farmlands and that was that many. But it was like the small farmer is about that much more. 
Yes. What do you think about. 
The people and the scenery. It was a big that made a big difference because people coming from all different areas these different states to live here and building homes and building stories and that the population increased what it was before in every area go to what a big difference it was like you look at. Sites which country country. So it's a bit different and as you look they're coming back from Townsville to homes and that's how have know they've built up so many pleasant plains all the areas that are that way they build up the stores out and all you know and you see that we never thought it would be like that today. And as you come further down the Mall to Macy's and all that has changed all over. 
Yes we are becoming a cultural yes. 
So all the time you have to for both of you imagine like somebody you never know. No concept no concept of anything you're talking about given a little detail. You know it's you know like I said What did main street look like when you were growing up. Oh after shave. It was just like. 
Nomads. By being country they're mainstream you had a couple of stores. 
The post office precinct the drugstore and and there was there was a large what was up there and a few stores and people in an apartment before that on Main Street was on much of anything. 
So like I said the movie there the drugstore that was increasing its just about all that we had they had a Altes or something there himself as a cross and white we or something like that for I was a boy wasn't that when there was still just a store for people living in stores and that wasn't that much to it. So I get built up more so much more was out there and that taught me like it was you know busy. 
And I guess if you had had the stores more stores pleasure to get out. 
But even though like now it's build up so much more says I've been here. But there's a big difference then now that it was you know when I moved here but out there what it was like was like an area like this that was so it. 
So people do well. 
Growing up my mother my father used to take the ferry to Perth Amboy job their factory jobs that they worked. 
My mother worked in the garment. My father was like it was a melting or something like that factory there and they would take the ferry take the train to come down to jobs down this way but there's few jobs here on site. Now come back to bite you you try to. Keep. Up. The Sydney and I'll go to Townsville to get the jobs in Jersey to take the fair Eagle that then that had the ferry from down here to Richmond here I would go over to Jersey and they would have said they didn't have all the bridges had Outerbridge in the Vale bridge. And they built up a bridge you know and that wasn't that much in fact that factory in town they all had Neshama smelting factory there and there was very little. Where they used to go to. To. 
Jersey. 
So most communities said yes it is right so I used to go to I had but not that many. 
SIMON HILL Yes they used the word Manhattan like I say they used to go to Jersey take the Bay Bridge. I mean they owned ferry and from Port Richmond here and. Tried to get all the states mixed up. 
Impoverishment would go to China straight when you go injuriously. 
Now that the NY ferry from Townsville had that Port Richmond ferry over to the second Bay was Bayonne like that you know that would be the visible things like. 
Yes a little hard for someone like you. 
So all my mother worked in the garment factory where they made really nice stores you know dresses coats and she would help they said you could cut some out this is digital and things like that together. 
I follow them melting sorting something out of them for it and also work it out that way and that's what they did two of them did you know yes there was as many jobs to be had. 
Yes. So as you said. 
I worked. When I graduated high I worked in an Church in New Jersey for Westinghouse. Used to go to make air conditioners and television. Word comment factory like that. And like I said before there were other in the garment factory. And so I used to take hairdryers survived with a and from Titusville to pick me up and go to my church and ask when we go to Westinghouse Westinghouse attach images. And that's the way. My brother worked in Union New Jersey. And he was a. 
Factory making making tools. That's what he did. You were there were making tools and things like that. He advanced his position. And that's why he made what with you do it. But my sister she worked at a garment factory with my mother. She worked there for a while and see when she got married that was you know I was just about it. Yes. 
So the people in my family now have of the oldest one which is b b pricing. Oh and nephew. 
He's the oldest one. He's worked for the Board of Education. 
And my niece she's a professor in Brook college and my nephew. 
He was a teacher. He became a fireman had. 
Retired after 9/11. She retired after 9/11 and his wife is says she's a teacher in Brooklyn. And. 
Golf. This is my nieces and nephews my brothers. 
She works for issues of law and family. 
She was involved in the sand house works. 
He's a restaurant in Brooklyn. He's a manager there and they go with us when he's retired from the sanitation. 
Said my niece. Stephanie is Professor cannister. 
Dad and they're my my my oldest. They were for the sanitation department. They both of them and the sanitation the work that the garbage is things that one drives a truck and one takes the garbage dumps the garbage off the street. It's what these two. Because she works part time for our shop right. 
She just goes in except or is on the phone in Finland and gives it to the young people there. 
So what are people often order and she gives them paperwork on that and that's how she knew there then they go out and fill the orders and they have someone as severe as him. 
Now they're trying to keep her last summer. You're asking how does that sound like I would ask about the progress. Trying to hold back the very first mother. 
Yeah. So. I think over the years fantastic jobs has said they made in their lifetime and so like I say my oldest nephew before he retired thing where he advanced he was in this fashion. 
And he became a supervisor. And like I said my. 
Nephew they invest in the board of education what with war with the children give him more instructing and teaching them. And. Kevin was saying that was the teacher the fireman and he's retired. 
And the sister she is teaching and she became a professor at Brook college. She advanced at Stony Brook college and the first art exhibits. The. Famous. 
And my nephews there is your oldest nephew's wife. She used to work at a boarding a trailer for size. What Richmond. 
She retired from there. 
And so we have Mary and the youngest boy Mary they have a wonderful wife she's a teacher in Brooklyn and the three girls you the full girls the oldest one is going to Stoneybrook college. 
I mean I'm just like wow. 
I think the family is doing a fantastic job. And I said I made a mistake in seeing my niece the other Stoneybrook college. 
She has to do. She's going to Duke University and they are dying and she's doing fantastic job there driving. 
Coming here were any loving and caring about her. Well she's doing a fantastic job for education and concerned and being a nice polite young lady and we are blessed for that. 
And our sister Jade in Deseret they're going to school and then had their twins and they're in sports and they're doing a fantastic job. 
Like her sister when she was in high school she was involved in the soccer ball across the hall and there just like her and they're doing a fantastic job. Now it was going to school on sat down. They transferred. That mom and dad bought the suburban school and they transfer their eighth grade with their. 
So is I feel so proud. 
I'm so happy and I constantly telling them I continue to do well and they're doing the right thing. And God bless them. 
And I'm here for them whatever I can do to keep on doing well that's the main thing. Be safe. So much going on as far as me but thank God they do. I'm so happy and proud of the family. I mean truly blessed. So back. 
What you have got to talk about. No it's just about like I said I haven't been down to rise Silva spent a time there. 
Years. One time I was one back. 
That's in the family and you go back to the funeral. Know be there for a couple days. And Riceville a very small town like I say if I could by coming in a light emitting light going out as I was a child and this very small town and I. 
And I haven't been there nine years. The last time I kind say I was there is I think a chance to to see anything but you wonder whether that was where I lived. Was that a country until I moved to Dublin. 
There was this country highway that very little traffic in Riceville there very little traffic and like I say that was just like I can tell you everything around your house like the houses but you see they didn't have any lights. It was on a farm. That was a rice field and you had the kerosene lamps you had to expand that from the farm. 
You had installed stoves and I say it's just it was comfortable we are comfortable. 
That's why it was in that day. This is the text panels where you kept the pigs the pigs on the farm. But what you would do with the pigs pen is bring them in the pig the pigs. When you plan to kill them so they will get fat. 
You see them feed them see them. They will get sad because out on a farm there is really not doing anything. They're not just in the pen they keep eating and so they get fat. The new Reggie kill them they will eat the pig. And that's why you would have the pigs and I have had that with Sarah from all the world there were cane make the syrup from the farm. 
And then you have your own corn then they have their own cotton cotton for the flowers. 
No Should made the flowers and things out of things. 
Oh I hope so. 
Yes. Right. 
You make the sugar cane you take it at a mill like a grinder. You bring in there and you feed that into the ground and a squeeze the juice out in this container. Then they had this large huge tub. Like. A. Big tub they would put that in all the juice from the cave and you know how to cook it you make a fire under that of which are troubles elevated on some breaks. You put the juice cane in that. 
So and yet you cook it down and so you've made the syrup. That's right you could take several syrup. You had enough for your home and things like that. Then they had the cotton farm cotton whenever cotton on the farm. 
They will you picked the cotton you take it into the mill and I take the seeds out of the garden and then they would take that and they make make matches and make quilts they make all that either of them would get the seeds in there. 
And they said they would patch that get the material out to get material so it together like you see like you see a patch quilt today. That's what this looks like like that. So what does. It sends out more here. Because I grew up here I I was young when I came here it blew up when you had more than you had there was rice fields a beautiful quiet little country town very very nice. 
And like I say I can't say that much about it much nicer it naturally it's still a quiet town because I went down for the funeral and things like that. But it's it's it's it's. It's a quiet place but I said no to. Because there's more here more to do for people you know and more advantages are there than there because what that was found there that you could do because there was factories here and you don't have the factories and things like so was the transition from it was just the idea of getting used to how people would treat you. You know. They had the attitudes to be nasty instead of being friendly and nice and here for each other. 
But you felt more down south because there was more prejudice and they are no prejudice no one as bad as on as bad as the South because. 
Because there was war people lost. You dealt with more people. That's what made it. Yes yes. Do you think. It would make you sad and disgusted because. It was taught to do the right thing and be polite and be there for each other. Because of who what are and how when you see them when they're being prejudiced or being nasty. And even I have said why are against the black masses of black against the whiteness of blacks against the black Lassie is just why some people are. And it's hard to see how people could be so nasty when you've been nice and polite to them. And why can't they treat you the same way as you treat them. There's no need no reason for that. Why. Well I want to be like that. Life is too short. You are blessed. God have you on Earth. And you are blessed to be here to share this with us of a cowboy or a race or what have you. We don't need that here for each other means thankful and letting. God know that people know how much we appreciate everyday and that's what counts. Now that said so still today you see people still being nasty. I won't care what race what about where some people are just nasty. Nasty among their own race that their hair color and everything is just me. Some people just have problems. 
Pray and help them that's all we can do. So. You're just. Of. That house. I save up to. Use. Of. 
Pepper time with the shot. Take the ferry going to pretend to shop and go to church stores nicer nice stores. Walk up Smith Street and then do your shopping. Now that was nice. It was a pleasure to get out and go into that. You know. Gas. And. Be among the people. And people are pretty way of saying Which church people do things like that are nice. They. 
Just said they were so registers. Oh yes was an impression which is this is very new york you know what. 
About the South. Yes. So it was was nice that way and news treated that way. You know. 
The I have pledged to go over there and get more smiles. How are you. You know I say go going to church and doing your shopping except for food shopping the clothing shopping and that was everything. You know so many nicer that way to get. Out. Of. What neighbors like. Well. My neighbors there was like. I. Said wheat. 
And Rice there was I was out there in the country you know. 
So it was a minute wasn't it. No that wasn't close down way down. You could see a house over there somewhere away. You know it wasn't like the farm. 
And then we moved into town after we left the country and every town where there was a houses was closer that some of the people just just don't want to be bothered. 
And they just had attitudes. Yes we the black people yes on the black neighborhood. I don't see. 
The black people that live there. 
No I don't remove them or remove them at all. I really wasn't a refugee left right field. 
And went to double. Said we stay there. My mother came up and I. Thought I was up. They. Were. 
Black and but they there wasn't the throngs of people. It wasn't that easy even going to school there and. Things like that. It was just something that just wasn't friendly. So long as we kept ourselves. And. You know you try to get involved you want to be friendly you want to be nice. Some people just don't appreciate that. And know how to be nice. And do the right thing you know. My mother always told my parents. All my past mother father grandparents tells you do the right thing you don't have to worry. And. See that's what we always have couldn't do right. We just evolved. We just involved mothers kept self cause you don't do the wrong thing. And that's what that's the way we. 
Would break my mother's heart. 
You will go to jail or something like that. The main thing you heard in your family was when you're doing they are there for you and they're doing the best they can and everything and you go out and do the wrong thing. Why would you want to go out there and do the wrong thing. With so many children. Have parents that didn't care. And you can see why they got involved in the wrong things. Because the press wasn't there for. 
Like I say arranged with all the Townsville I've got to say Georgia those people there wasn't a friend. 
There was wise there was there was apartment house that we know the first visit a little little place. So my mother found the stuff I was our apartment house. And. Even the ones it's all black in the apartments but there wasn't that it wasn't that friendly. And that's why more or less and there was some some blacks up the street there in the nice home. And there wasn't a friend or Lauzon was saying that they are oh you're from the south. 
And you don't you know I was I was too good. 
I just had turned 12 when I moved here from Georgia. 
Yes I can say they don't want to be bothered. 
WALLACE But you're from Georgia you don't know this Latin the other. 
You're right. 
Yes. And so is this that's why we more or less. To ourselves. You know. 
I have a sister ship. She's five years old. And then when she like I say I'm graduated and went to her mother and she met some people and that's how she was she met a system that was working there and that's how she met her husband there where they live. To assist it's not that way that way South Jersey people more. It wasn't that much but it did go out as we got older we saw go into dances. Down at St. George that had the name of the place and Cromwell center. Center. You say about it which is going the right way to go down like this once a month then bam twice a month they would have dances there and like my sense of divide which has got to be our in-laws to come over and she said boy what the brother in law and she got together as a comment over two dances. Then my son went to George's dances. So I had to stop meddling that way. And my brother was into sports. And. He got involved that way. And so. I was just as all of us as friends. One is how I met them. Yes dances. And they had. You said Count Basie. 
Dizzy Gillespie which has a name. 
There's used to be over here the big large names I'm trying to think it is. And then they had the local bands over here like Eric just said. And I don't know. Now we play with Count Basie they always be down from us. Yes. So either I have a little local parties where I was there during that time there the live bands and that was a thing there faster than ever that dancing had to go out and have a friendship. You meet different people. You dance and have fun. You say you. Is the fuel that was that was not that many not that many because I can say those things and all they didn't involve other families and all that bother you know and see me go my sister. And. She didn't invite her in-laws or just say which was surely they hadn't gotten married yet. They would come out as a band. The dance is over. And we all need to get together a couple who because up and take us around them. A lot of fun that way you know and down at mission. That they had the bands of lay. 
Down on them. What touched down on. Richmond cherish and. Be a club in the name. No he wasn't always like on the opposite side of the border. They were that place over there. Know how we go to have deficits down there. But man fans come here to the fans on it. I can't think of it from Wilson. So from what I said I can't think of the name of the other place. But they used to have a. Guy's name bands there. And so like I said I'd get to base it although it was really good at that time I got friendly with him and introduced a friend of mine that played with Count Basie from a friend of mine she's in New Jersey. And. 
That's nice too. So let's have some fun the dances Nafez. That. Is. 
Because it is in the south it was precious and all I want to read it is still have the black in the whiteness said now. I like that they were very few white and the blacks and very few blacks in the way. 
So that's why it was like. We. 
Were like swing you know like that place as you know you want to play that swing for the dance right. Oh it always has. 
You're always just very nice to also out when they come dressed to go. But with all this as 5 per cent boy crowd Smith Street not too far from the ferry we still go there and there's a lot of shopping there and there was. I can't find a name is two of them. 
Civilians. We used to do the main thing and get our shooting civilians and nice expensive shoes just to have a missable then get. We like the shoes in the store was just this just for dancing. We were well you know the thing is the mother wanted to dance next week. I had them I just want to dance it was almost issue like that. You know. It. Wasn't. 
It wasn't that. Once in a while they have a house party. Out of the lines. All depends on who's having it. Because like some people you didn't deal with because there was drinking and nasty carrying on so you just involved with them. 
You know I didn't know what it was like those afraid of them like knives and things like that. You hear this on this. Oh no you don't do that. You know. So you go through that. So. It's to be like I said quite a few housewives but it. All depends on who's having them. Because you know. 
You just don't do those things. You never let them be involved in those type of people. We never did. 
Really stick out. This. Family being there for family. We used to go to Philly that feel out to visit my mother's sisters. She said she was all of them. 
She had two sisters there and she going still be there. You got to visit them and they used come to visit. Me and I said. It. Is the bond of family visits. You know. I mean everything in the world. So. I. Had a loving caring child. Because. My parents was always there for. 
The family was close. I've had other sources in Philly but it was still close. And she had valises enjoys it. So during the trial of another telephone the telephone. We got the news monopole. But still that it was right all the time. Every time I was writing letters. You know. So that's the way it was. We had the bond with the family that was. 
With everything in the world. So. Because. That's when. The. From. What. Would. You say about. Her. Yet right because. You know. We didn't deal with the ones that was causing the trouble. Whether it was black or white on rice what race. 
We had white friends that was so nice. We had. Very few the black ones because it was many around. But we did nice things was there for family. We had a bond together. We did live here. They are like I say you couldn't be here. 
And I was involved in sports and school and I guess my brother my sister she wasn't that much in the sport she was a sports person. 
What was involved with the nicer people doing the nicer things and we always will be proud. And made our family proud and they was there for us at all times best that way you know especially my mother she was always anchor care what it was or what she was right there at all. 
I was more like a quiet like happy quiet person. And I always try to be pleasant and nice. You know. I just started wearing makeup and a little bit when I went to high school. And. My mother made sure. That we didn't have parents. Back in those days. No other pants. We had our dresses used to make us some. And she bought it. And she made sure that we had and my brother had. 
She would deprive herself of things so she could have it there for us. She was always there for us. And that's the way it went. Bust. 
Oh they used to wear used to wear the pageboy boys come down on a and then they say have this some white knight that pushed up the pageboy wasted. Then they used to have braids at times heavy and braids pageboy when it comes down. 
It goes all the way around like down the street. No no. They have the curl and they have it down where just curl and curl inside. Yes that hair come down straight and and here it was curl. 
Inside like this. Now it's. I have a home. 
Of a curling iron comb to straighten it out. Then I used curling on held the curl it and then I would have the rose of a cold night set my alarm early I was spinning maybe about half 45 mins certain days and I just had to just braid it small and then take that long. And by curl that would take me maybe that. 
Maybe 45 minutes. I wrote that us. 
To make it easier. So what is the speed at. 
Skeezer. 
You know you're the Coleby and yeah right. 
I mean that he is about to cutting early and short they weighed this way. So yeah well we're siblings like growing up there. I guess. All my siblings and my nieces nephews. 
Brothers and Sisters oh all my sister she was the oldest she's 5 year old and my brother is 3 years old and I'm the youngest. 
The three of us was always close. We are very close bond. 
Would you say your sister issues for us all the time. 
She's right there for us. Even when she got married and she in Germany and said now she was right there whatever she could do and my brother was right there with her. 
It was a wonderful wonderful loving caring couple just as my sister's name is Robbie Onno Dinkins Omary name and my brother Thomas Highwood curry. 
No I was never see them like that. All together all together. I'm glad it didn't make a difference because of the age or what mother was always the same. Each of their personalities. Russell's personality she is a sweet kind patient person and just wish you were always was it. 
I don't remember her being there fighting and the confusion that we can get in my mother and I pass outside no of the night that she was. 
Yes she was the same thing. 
S.A first time he ever got a beating in high school. He played. His first day in high school he plays hooky escape school. My mother took him to school and beat his behind and never happened again. There was never anything there confusion or bickering. As sisters and brother. No other problem wasn't anything like that. 
You. 
Oh it was amazing. Oh no. No. No I just I just. When I was in sixth grade. I hit a girl. You call me a bad name quest. It is. That was a nigger. And I wouldn't say she was white. Fisher Namoi road fishing. Right. And I never had a problem without the nasty person always tried to be nice and respected me. 
Should have never more than just what she deserved. 
Not really. 
No one doing anything like that. 
Because you know why that's why I like to question. 
So I don't how why would the siblings out there know what I did wrong. They expect me to do that again. So I never never liked that. So I try to tell the truth in a nice way. 
Just forgot about it. Right. 
Best friends who are my best friends growing up issues. 
I really didn't have any best friends. The first. 
And I was surprised at her saying something like that. Was that what I could get him out to dances and things. Come on that day and I called him everyday. You're going to get him out of the house. You know. It wasn't even your brother in law. With. 
Me. You always that was him as he's always depressed getting him out of the House he ran off in the water trying to commit suicide. 
So no no no I said it's a blessing in my mind that was my sister's husband. 
Well you said I would try to put my sister's husband you don't do things like I did. 
He was so depressed. 
So you have the friends I have friends like a friend. 
There is that the thing is Alabaman. She's in she's got friends with her at work. But. They were so envious of me getting this job being the first female. 
And being black all the black and white was in tears. So they accused me of so many things and then it was nasty to me. But I just kept my head up and smile and get right inside out of Westinghouse she made airconditioners and I had like a at assembly line I worked on the assembly line. And that I finally got. Promotion. And they used to do the wiring and the soldering the things they used to do there and I got promotion I had like 150 people on the line. And I was responsible for them to do the job right. And to get the production of that on time. And people was envious. Of me getting it. Even in management there was interviews. But I had a wonderful supervisor. He's originally from Virginia. 
And also he was he was the first black in management. And he's from Virginia. He had a real southern accent and he asks me about becoming a supervisor and his daughter had kidney failure. He found that my sister grandmother had. Kidney failure. 
And he used to go in and call me and ask for a meeting. And we sit down we talk about. His condition and his daughter's condition. 
And would that be very close. And they are saying are you going with him working with him. 
We talked about his fight about my sister's condition because his daughter was having the same problem. And it was getting worse and worse. 
That's just like my sisters had that way and they were saying I was going with him. So I said well until the day we are still good friends. But. 
White black and spanish Puerto Ricans and I was so so was so nasty and envious. 
So I used to walk back down looked straight ahead Hello smile on I. 
It was the one to speak otherwise I just kept walking. 
So I retired. 
Yes. And was. 
I guess a hell of a lot because you know like I was there for him to help him with the daughter's condition. 
You're right. I could comfort him and be there for him. Because when she first started out. 
He couldn't believe it. And then. 
We started talking and that and I told him about my sister and that that was so close you know. 
Yes. And I got a sense it's a day. We're still friends. 
I talk to him about three weeks ago now. I owe him a full life and this Christmas card always still if Rachel Levy was all my retirement he still was so good friends with us. 
His daughter lived about six seven years after my sister. After she passed. He knew. 
She had a kidney failure and she built of her own rejection. And that was it. So that's how we get we say so close. It was never age. You know you hit this because you. 
Know I have to give a shot something to it. What is this is walking. 
Thinking like 300 about 300 plus. It's like it's one day over there. 
I'll let myself go. I love you. 
That everything went well. Home friends and all. 
So say you're in this scenario. Like when you were a little girl were teenager what. What are some things that you might. Think. That story is pretty good too. 
Hanging out with family and go shopping. That was a perfect day. That was the family. The family was shopping and purchased. 
Things that the family wanted. So why is this happening for them. If you think your life would be like. 
Yes I plan my life to be different. I was going to get married and have. Four children. But due to having surgery young. 
My friends I was engaged. That's. Why. They wanted children and I and. Want to say good now children so I just broke the engagement. So I think when they have a family. 
And they want to talk about children my sister and talk about children and my rather than talk about you like I did I was going to have to into two girls and two boys. You talked about. 
I wonder why I had. I had. Started out I had when I got my monthly period. 
I started getting cramps my somebody hurt me so bad. And I went to Dr.. And they told me I had to sit on my ovary in a tube on the womb and I had to take it medicine and this. It told me I had to have this hysterectomy. I told the doctor just let me try to have at least one child. They said no you can't. Get condition you can't. I thought I'll go out of my mind. And that's what I've wanted to do. I had to go along with it. My. Brother came to the hospital that night. Twelve o'clock at night trying to console me and the family trying to console. We came back 12 o'clock that night. I had to have it because I had. A cyst and a tumor and all that and then I have so many operations up to that full operation that. So that's why I'm. Deprived of not having children. So I guess it wasn't meant to be friends she said and fiance. They like to talk about shoes. And I couldn't. 
Tell them I couldn't have been Bob so I never did. And you say it's is it's fulfilled. 
Thank god I have. I was here for my mother. She passed my sister's children and my brother's children in a different way. Because for me like I say God makes no mistakes and. With my sister passing young. And. Being have a family. And like I said my brother in law. Having. My. 
Helping the family. You can't couldn't be all the family that said Thank God like us he was just to pass and help the children. If the children have been raised the children as I can say God makes no mistakes. 
That's what you do. 
You don't know I don't dwell on because it was her passing as it is here I La Raza. I can say Stephanie was just six when she passed. 
And I helped him raise them with him being depressed and everything. So what could I do. Try to be supportive of it and that's what. Caused me to do this. I would say well why take her and have me. 
With you on. Oh and I. Want it. 
It just broke my heart the thoughts of that. And I said Well like you say God no means makes no mistakes. He. 
Helped out so I. 
His reasoning. I can't question God. You know I left it at that. 
So we talked a little about memories. But do you have any childhood memories bad or do that just the down. I. Mean the best things that happened to you. How old were you when you had to get this. No I was I was I was I was. 
That. I don't know because they try give different medication. And I. Had a. Sits on the ovary. 
And a tour on the home before they did the hysterectomy. Then they told me that the. Had to do this directive. And that's why I said let me just try. And they said no you can't. 
Do that. So I'm sure I would have that will lead into something else and it's something I forgot what it was. Is I would never have been able to have shielded. 
Against Mississippi did best for the family I'm here for each other and doing the best I can. 
And the shopping like I'm doing now is going out of place. Some people don't know what a pleasure that is. And I said God is so good. He makes no mistakes. And supposed to go out which is all the time each and every time. 
I mean everything in the world for me. What is your town. That good games. Play. 
Play play. You know why don't you cover the thousands. Well you know I thought when of the day and I know it says I did. I didn't play that well with his friends because I didn't have any friends. I'd say why they didn't want it bothers me because we just so the family in town. No there wasn't anybody there in school that was really around to be friends with. 
So it was more of this family as we just playing and hopscotch and jump rope and things like that. That's what we did is we did for see I forgot all about them. 
I got to play cards. Now I'm so sick and all that I forgot all about ever what we did. 
Did you play with anything like song that went down in Ohio. Jump rope. I'm saying that song like double dutch you know singing so that's like you say I've been around the world. But yeah you play that man that and. 
Like I say it's hard to say. 
When you're a that's like you alone and I did I didn't regret it because the South was not around to be friendly with you to be nice with and that was just that's just the way it was. So but. It is blessed that they had us that was a loving caring family which meant everything. 
You know. That's what it meant. 
Also with my dolls I little the dolls changing their clothes and their hair and all that. 
You know that's what I'm thinking that the dolls represent the young black. Why would you say this is all of all white dolls. 
It was a pleasure because you didn't have them. And that's what you're saying. So that's what we play with. Yeah. And that's what we play with. It was a pleasure that I had the dolls that play with you know as my main thing. Now all home made you. 
Know what Mother Mother would buy the toys and the toys. Like I said toys that we play. You know that was like. 
When you or your mother like. 
Yes it makes sense because of your best father. 
I made the matching outfits. Jack things or something. So that's. You know home entertainment. Radio and I had a few records a record player of. Like your name some day some day artist. 
I should like Count Basie Dizzy Gillespie know they play different all different music that is slow dance so they call it the slow drag and they call slow now they know the slow dragging a slow dance you know and things like that. 
So you. Right. 
This thing with it. 
No no no no no. Just a few just a few. 
You see what the radio said about this and really I didn't see very much. 
This album is so so so so much. So I was like OK mother didn't like that much. 
Followed here sit there on the news hegemonism stuff like his room there in the kitchen now what have you you know. 
So it involves a mother should know was this the right tone. 
No it mother told us that those stories in this story. 
Know what she says fairytales that's all. 
I just it. No no I got so much. Get so. Tradition making. 
I said I just live the the dog was not used. 
So my own clothes as near as I grow up I used it so that way you know and things like that I used to do. Yeah. Thank you so much. 
So now loving and caring for each other. Doing the best you can by all. 
And not hurting anyone's feelings. There's a misunderstanding you can resolve it by talking and without giving a nasty attitude and being very. 
Call me a light water. You're here for each other and to do the right thing. Somebody made a mistake. 
Listen to them and helped to resolve it and be there for them and that's what the most because it describes was means for us like you describe exactly right. 
Everything you name it. I got to say it's unexplainable because you show it. You let them know that you're there for them. And because of what it is or how. It's just hard to put into. Other words that I'm not the person that you love me and don't just say it you mean it from the heart. It means for me your heart. It sure is from now. And you can't love because it's from the heart. 
You can't buy it. Sense is priceless right. Right. 
More important it is let's say you can buy it was more important than you know loving and caring. If you don't have a penny for them which you loving and Care Express. 
Talk about it. I shall try to get the family and all know. 
How I love and care for them. And I'm here for them. You know everything I can do. 
For them. Daza how small or how large or what if it's just a kind word that I'm here for them to say just to go out and get something I can get a gift for them. 
That's why I was singing like that because that's what it means to me onco care what you have. You can't say good thing with you when you leave. And check out and go to another world. Put your shoulder to love and care while you're with them. So when they say actions speak louder than words comes. 
Yes. At times it all depends on what it is. 
But it's also right to write that the you know self love like you being selfish in other words no selfish love that were into no no. 
Because you know why if you did said that self love you just said by yourself you just there in the world of your own and didn't do the rest. 
Well I don't mean like loving yourself as lovely as ever. No I mean like loving everyone. Loving yourself and loving everyone. Else as much as you love it. 
So I believe in loving them more of myself because they are here for you and you are here for them in this show your love that means everything in the world if you don't show that you love and care. 
It's a sad thing just as being a selfish person. And what it will do for yourself you're just there alone. 
Yes. So like you said. You know when. You said people don't. Think your. Culture people don't think you deserve it. 
Yes because you're right. Right. That way you accept this because this is me and I'm proud of me and then saying your love and you care for yourself that part that you say don't put yourself down because of anybody else you love you care for yourself. And then as fighting show the loving care for someone else but just you could just be me. You don't not amount to anything. 
So you feel like if you can't accept you can't you can't accept it. Right. Right. Same thing so loving yourself other people that way. Right. So is it fair to care for some of the people. 
I have pride in what I want and what I want to do and I want to see good results. Then I'll go and take care of these things. Do these things get the good results. 
That my look what I did look like accomplished to get this get this far and to get what I want. That's what makes me feel good that way. Than that think there's any other way. Like I said I did this because of I'm so proud I want to look at this love for me. You know. That's what makes me feel proud that way. 
Yes. Was it difficult before. Yes. 
No. Because you know why. I know me and I know how I am because of what who I am what race I have where I come from. 
I have the pride and I want to move forward because of what is or isn't. And I would never let myself down to lower myself to something like that. Because whatever whoever however I'm doing the right thing and that's what counts. Oh yes right. Like I say if I make any mistakes help me please help me forgive me and turn me around. Yes. And have they given for the mistakes I've made. And every night I tell them that they give me and I'm not I'm aware of mom as they showed me and helped me and turned me around. 
You are the most important person there is because if you going to lower yourself who will go on the help you if you don't you're going down yourself all the time but have your pride and keep yourself look up regards to make mistakes turn around to correct your mistake and then that's why you keep moving you. 
Yes so let them know. What if you don't he is going to be down. And down have down always have the pride. 
And do the right thing until you are proven wrong when you're proven wrong. He's OK you're correct the mistake I made. And don't keep saying that. OK then. No I didn't make the mistake. But. Until you are proven wrong. Keep your pride up and do the right thing. And if you are proven wrong. Oh I didn't realize you're right. 
I made a mistake that up the good work in helping me. 
You learn you learn from the mistakes all of that. 
I know that you learn from the mistakes because until then you're always right. Oh yes I didn't realize that was that wasn't right. I made a mistake there. Like I said you said God please forgive me and whoever the person was forgive me for the mistake I made. You know I didn't realize at the time and I made a mistake. 
Yeah they have mercy upon us. 
That's what we have to do. 
I have faith in God and faith in myself and I put faith in people up until they let me down. And I like to do too. And I thank God. Morning and night. And during the day every day of my life and God is to protect us keep yourself safe. Out of all hurt harm or danger on and doing the right thing by all means forgive us for us. 
And I mean that from my father my every day of my life. 
Yes. All right. Do you think the faith that you have in other people is something that you just automatically have until they prove you're wrong. Or do you think it's something that. They have to. 
Like they have to yes. 
I see I have faith in them and until they're proven wrong because of how can I not have faith because doubting that people have the faith in them prove it wrong. Oh yes. All the faith I haven't you. 
You let me down like that. That's. No question about was your. Racial bias. I know that is all black what African-American from the beginning and say This is my thing on that day and Beck and rather than let those would in the. 
You know I'm not just giving that up is bothering you. OK. OK. So you're African-American. 
Prior to slavery. Right. You know we don't really know this. Right. 
And that's it. 
My mother and mother and the father all died Juju is now generating OK. 
Grandma great grandmother she's an Indian in her but I don't know what you know. 
I don't know it's because I left. 
Well you know so as far as you know as far as you can remember both your mother and father are from pretty much where you are. Right. 
Either way back before you were a child. Now Thanksgiving tradition. 
It's the same old traditions same as they have today. That's all I saw. 
So you say I mean the holiday it's the holidays to celebrate them the holidays. 
Was there some specific food that Sally Cook ever could. So so so that's what bad stuff was suffering from that was it when you came a tradition. Same tradition the same food that was eating the collard greens. I would say. Potatoes are right which is dish. Maybe a place you. 
Know all that much vacation. 
We didn't shop. 
This is as I say it's a holiday shopping that was addition for the holidays. 
So there's the same thing now you know going to the shelf and being happy that way in here each other. 
Yes. 
Uses my siblings here because that's the main thing because it was we were close like cousins the ones that Filion and those close calls cosied I'm saying like I have with your children. 
Now this is the use of my whole life. I don't know what I would do without you. I'm not saying because you I mean they're not. 
Yes. You mean everything in the world to me and Stephanie and her sister's children grandchildren and my brother and his grandchild. So it means every everything remember the stories that will be told by others. Said. 
I can't think of anything. 
Yes I know he remembers them. He could tell them like mad. All the time. I don't remember them. Lives were his jokes. Every day as a joke. 
I mean even though this is the loving care and the touching and the being of value that's that's the that's a thing. 
That's what means everything in the world to me. Being a part here for you and being a part of you know that's that's my whole life. I don't know what I would do without just telling you. So I try to tear down to bring his grandchildren over and get over. 
And I still have his children in the bed gets on the bed for Christmas. Is this. Show you know. 
I don't know. But. Back in the. 
Because it wasn't like it was and I quote like those in Washington. It was like it wasn't close said Do you know anything about our generation before you know. 
Curve she is was she married him it wasn't. Curry. 
Right. 
Being a slave. You know the thing about me you know. 
Any traditional first name nicknames and your fixed Rodney is I'm jealous. I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you. 
Let me even say play Bezzerides middle name is my name is Carol My name is Rob.

No don't. 
Oh I see. So when you first this I just said turned 12 so I just got. I just.

Did you remember what was going on with Don't you remember the. 1947 civil rights roles before the. King like the South so segregated. Is. 
Segregated South in the same way that you said that just like people with the right it wouldn't be like Oh right. That is a way of life. 
This and I never thought of anything like this. I'm just asking. 
But I mean I think we can get more into that later. So what does your thinking when you can. 
Just just close enough back if you execute that there are thing we have got you. So close and then no because that apartment that he doesn't have that much room. No one has been closer to him. How did you get. My mother was not on the train on the train to the train. So he's present from this frozen suitcase and a little suitcase like that. What was the journey like. This moment. It was exciting but it was tiresome. Calls coming from Georgia up to here. I it was tiresome. Did you just. No no no multiple. That's a train that's how we get the train. You remember where you stopped. You know what. I just turned 12. It was tiresome. Are you excited. Excited about coming those. Had you heard stories about that a lot. More liberal than to say it was one liberal and. Some change. 
My mother my mother came here first mother and father came first. Then two years later we came. We stayed in Dublin with my aunt for two years then we came up when they found a place. We came. Here in Dublin enjoyed. 
This calls from other sister she never had children. 
Very sweet. What was your first experience. 
Experience that I have in this state. I mean. Yeah I guess so. Ms. It was just. Being. The. School system in school. 
Traveling it was altogether different change compared to down there with you. You know the. School system. A whole. Environment. To a certain extent like you know your shopping. Education you are just all that bomb and you know like there are more opportunities. 
Yes you know a young them. So the people there wasn't that friendly but says more opportunities and we worked to that advantage of that. So that's what that concept of. Is tomorrow be a better day. That's what your dream was because of what it is today. 
Tomorrow a better day. Foster. First a little bit more than the southern states because they'll tell you this is this and this is that still it takes time even to the day some of the things are still still nasty. What traditions or customs have you made to. Say like. 
All those things you know those things will be wonderful things. 
Yes I think other family family get together can't beat us and so sorry I missed it this time. You know I didn't miss Thanksgiving. I'm saying this is the thing. Yes. 
That's when I couldn't make that is just the way I felt. You know it's just this sense of pleasure to look forward to that every year. That never changes. Anything else that you made a custom you that. 
Like anything that you said when you were coming to that. I think this may change my life. 
Even if there is something Southern about yes it was the love and care of this one. One thing the bond that the family always wanted to keep that. And be here for each other and do the right thing. That was the main thing that I always. Always. 
Felt that way. You know. 
Let me know if you get cold I close the door. No I'm.

So she's been to basically take all the answers and when I ask myself the same question and she's asking so let's get to merge them all together. Like almost like they're all part of the brain. Oh so it's like man a brain that had all of our knowledge in mind. And. 
That's three generations just that isn't like merging at all. 
But we have to say in our background. Yeah until like oh. Oh good if you say come tomorrow.

Bug can't think of anything special family traditions customs dish about food. 
You said I like special birthdays just just the happy birthday song that we have for the birthday and Klaas's community.

Oh it's just over the holidays. We just listened to the per se thing like. 
Getting together and praying. That's right. Holding hands saying our prayers hugging kissing and OK I'll be right special.

Pretty much the same. Pretty much the same. Foods of the same foods that comes out especially in Turkey and you have a roast beef or ham and Mac and cheese all the things that we used to have the stuffing. 
Yelled turned a green so college all the other this that it is you know make what mother has to make to make. That the main thing. 
Before that was mother like other family raised on those things was that mother used to make it that and you think that's what we used to have you know. So what a lot of it is from. 
When you did live on the farm what a lot of what it could be from a farm.

George is a quiet small town. I didn't know the population of it but it was a small quiet. Like I say. 
It seemed like a light coming into it a light in the middle and the light going out. That's how small Riceville was when I was there small very very very light traffic lights. There. 
Did you ever venture out of my town to go visit relatives. Like I said Savannah TENNO. Atlanta and Dublin were just about. To do a. Was just visiting there. I like DOUBLE VERTICAL I stay there longer with my mother's sister. And it was nice there. And I enjoy it because I spent my time there. 
Relaxing there you know. So tell me about your. It was like. Vegas had I have pigs cows. A couple of goats. And they grow cotton. And cotton on the farm came. So they could get the syrup and they made the syrup and. 
And that pear trees and apple trees on the farm. That's what we have. Not that many trees like that but we have a few that we had that they wanted to have. Only had a. 
Back there from the ground. My mother's parents grandparents. 
Well like I said that's OK. So you like it when you say you know how they came. No no I don't I don't. Because your mother was saying something about. Their. 
Land. But it was back then. Oh they lost it because it was I forgot what had. 
Happened in those days. I can't think of what it was. Those are. What I'm trying to think of the word to say what it was like in those days. With them you know. For them to lose as much as they had. 
Because what you did not kill anything like that. Think what it was now. Is there a lot of land but it lost a lot because. Of the. Oh sure I can think of it now. 
WERTHEIMER It was back. Back there. He was and it was he wasn't a slave but it just. 
The blacksmith was allowed to have. They just didn't have that much. When the losses they took the land. And that's what happened there but he had some land but not like them before. 
You know. Have yes it was taken away from because of their race. Right. He's still not as much say. 
You know that's what we did the fun part of it. Did you do anything else. No just feed the feed. The animals the pigs and the. Cows. 
And the and things like that. That was just about. Just. All. 
You have. 
No I don't have any. No I don't have anything like. This. 
You was put up by coming here. All the family died there. The last one was there I to get a sense of me but the people that was there didn't send it to me. But they do exist say they're out there someplace with. Somewhere. With my. Son with my. Uncles. Family. And uncles wise family. So I don't know where they even go because the way I try to contact she don't. 
She knows she promised to do but didn't do so us. We just lost out on it. So the one that you wanted to get back. We. 
He said Do I have videos. I said. I don't even remember his shoes. 
Look at that what he had there. And I wanted to get the one they flipped from his children when they passed over the bed. They passed enough uncle passed away. But. My. My uncles in-laws. They just. Destroyed my cell my what I tried to get it but they didn't get to me. 
Got it already. Can you describe it honestly. Do you remember. Whose picture activities. Are being documented. 
Really it was just the family pictures. That was my. 
Mind. 
My mother's sat have pictures of my father's. 
I don't really have maybe one and two of them but I have to my mother's side not my grandmother. 
There are others but I was close to that when I was out there with them. 
Oh yes. You know it just wasn't my. Baby picture like. 
This. It's just Portus. Like I say we don't have that maybe goes back in the day then we didn't take that many pictures wasn't you know. 
So it's just very seldom and you know when you look at them. 
Yes. That what you are seeing. Now a little bit about race. Somewhat race black race. 
Say. All right. But. Black America but my grandma was she has some Indian. In her. Background but I don't know. 
No to a certain extent. They really don't just get to me when when they. Come to people. Are. Racist. And that's what gets on my nerves. I could say we are all human. And you do the right thing here for each other because of what race of color. And that's the most important thing in life is try to get people to do the realize that. And do the right thing. That's the most important thing. You know. I really can't stand on. This is this is racist. It is actually you know how he is and with the attitude. You know he approached people like I was like especially the black don't kick him to the dirt ground. You know I'm white I'm I'm in control. I'm going to do these things. I can't stand even look at the paper or TV or what have you. I feel. Like. Because of his presidency you know. We did racist. 
Life. Oh nice. Oh just I asked her. I said I understand. I've experienced racism. How did you do it. I have experienced it a lot. Growing up. But. 
I see that that's a life. And. I was taught. To do the right thing in regards to who and what. And let them know you know how whites were. Treat me nice. Actually two nights of that I don't need to be bothered with you. Just leave me alone and I go that way. I know that it's not black here in a white was there. You know your limits. When I was young a little girl. So that's what you went by just you did bad people disrespect me. And do the wrong thing that's what I get on my nerves. So what can you. Explain some other races like. Not really only the. 
So I want because like I even say in dealing with work I had different people working for me. And there was a Spanish to the Puerto Ricans and there was. The Haitians and all they were black and all but still. Some have the attitudes and some nasty. And I think that the No. I am who I am and I respect you and you respect me as I don't bother. So I left it like that. 
They did the same way that they dealt the same way knowing how people are what the world is like. So they moved along with it just like that. And. Moved on and say. Thank God it could be worse. And that's just the way we dealt with it. Thank God. Hope tomorrow I'll be a better day. And that's what we did. Does your race help or hinder. 
Set you back. 
It all depends like you say when you go and you know and you have your pride your respect and your term you're doing the right thing. That's the most important thing in life. Long as you know you do it regardless of who or what. Because like I say. Some of the blacks are just as nice to me as what's the White. And the Spanish and the Puerto Rican. Haitians and also on them. But I let them know. Hmong as I was doing the right thing. I'm going continue to do the right thing and. Ask God to take care of and protect me and keep me out of all great harm and danger. That's what made me determined to keep on pushing and. What race or pair. Of Black. 
Mothers side. Yes. You could be any race. What would it be. I would still be just like I am today. 
Because I'm proud of what I am. 
I mean everything in the world. 
Yeah. So you would say your race is a very important part of your identity. Yes. 
Nowness only black. Maybe it's a from Somalia from Africa or someplace like that and. It. 
Until you're proven wrong. You keep on doing what you. Just taught right. And you know that you're right. If something comes up. That. Might make a change in life. That. Will help you better. And is the right thing. So when we would go make a change like that. So you think there. Are hardships that you face. Is. 
Kind of safe. Oh. Yes. If you say you say you say maybe you wouldn't listen to me. If I was white. 
I learned a lesson. If you say. Nothing like I say you would never want to live this way. 
It's almost like because what you have to go through to be working. 
Oh yes. And I know how I feel what you have had had to go because you deal with that. And what you know growing up. The family prepares you for this. In the right way until you're wrong. That's what you did. Yeah. And he was happy and proud. And you can prove that you know that you're right. And don't change because you know you make a change. And get in is just going the wrong way. So you're right from the beginning so you stick with the right thing to do the right thing. 
No. Just. Just outside something like that to make you understand. And like I say the one time when. The young lady but I was in grammar schools said nigger. And then I hit her. Other than that I was in a. Nasty fighting person. And as I got older. I let the people know I stopped working. That. I'm proud of who I am. You're not going to disrespect me. I respect you and you're going to respect me. And that. I don't have any part time for you. Even at work. I was there as a teacher. Did you know you want to do your job. And I got a promotion. That if you don't want to do this. You're going to leave I'll take you out to office. 
You don't want to be here. I didn't go. 
They really was verbal like I say yes I. 
Let them take them right out and then learn what they and what I was doing and they made that change. Else you wouldn't have a position don't have a job. And I wasn't going to I was a respected name that is going to respect me. I I get respect and I demand respect. Other than that you're not going to be with this. And I never got nasty or anything like that. 
I just took them and told them they want to be white and they would go. 
Yes. Yes I did way because my mother my mother prepared us to have your pride. And keep your pride and keep yourself. Nice. And respect. And talk with respect. And due to respect for like. Respectable things. And that's what can and that's what my. Can you tell me about your religious beliefs or spiritual beliefs. 
And doing the right thing by all means at all times. So where what. You don't is you're doing the right thing. And as far as. You believe in God as I believe in God yes. 
That's one of the main things you have the faith and trust that he's here for you. You don't respect him to let you know. 
Let him know that you know how much you appreciate these things and doing the right thing and that's the main thing. 
I think miracles could have I don't have any miracles. 
So just maybe just any acts of God that you know. Only God can give me a of they look at me. Just say something and say oh my God shall I think of something I could say that. He has blessed me in so many ways. 
That I can't come out a particular way to show. 
But having the faith in him with all the surgeries I've had here for me and give me strength to keep moving forward. That's the most important thing and I thank him every day of my life. 
Morning and night I'm thinking him let them know how much I appreciate loving and caring and family. And that's the most important thing and doing the right thing for each other. 
So you just. Yes I think so. 
What was the most profound spiritual moment. 
To tell you just to the I know my was my family my sister and my mother being given me the strength and the power to keep loving and caring so much. It just broke my heart. I want to. Live. I want to do it. I mean give me strength to keep moving. I kept it to myself a lot because. I didn't want to upset the family. But I love them so much. I just couldn't believe they left me. You know this is just couldn't believe me like the sound of going away when he passed away. Is it just if you were I was so sad and devastated and I was wondering why my sister had to. 
Go through all that she went through and being such a sweet loving daughter mother and know you know it just it's just so young to go through what she did. I was so hurt when my last mother even though I had all we had all those years it just just broke my heart. When you love and care like that it is explainable and you can get better. Like I actually got better. But I ask God to forgive me because we all want to go one day. I just couldn't believe that she. 
Is leaving me. 
Yes I was so depressed you couldn't believe it. Yes. Both of my nieces are so depressed with them. Yes I just love them. What can you say or do. Who am I to question God. 
Yes every god. Yes. 
Yes yes. Because I was I was getting so there that asking to forgive me for getting bitter with him taking them I see them as wonderful sweet people. 
It is. It is. It was. It was because like I said Lord look at the ones you're taking. And they're so sweet and good. 
That time it was a loving and caring. I got a little bitter because wasn't my sister and my niece. And by the way they did look at some that that was out there doing not doing the right thing and I was doing the right thing. And you took them away hurt them I had them sick and I just did it like that and I accept God forgive me because I know who am I to question you. And I had to go back and ask for forgiveness because because I love and care so much that means and ask them to forgive me for being like that and appreciate I appreciate everything I should be doing the best I can by all. 
Keep me safe and have all heard on the news and the right thing and good evening from us. 
I think it's more like a man like Imam because like Jesus Christ was always thought he was a man which is that's what I see. You see like a race no just I don't actually know thought of being as a race. 
I just same as don't question as same as being white but not he thought more white and black. I never thought of it that way. 
Thank you. Is it right. 
I try to do the right thing. And I pray and ask and take care of all. He was all strong and healthy safe respecting him and close and doing the right thing by Army not only me my family my loved ones even my friends. If I have enemies. That take care of them too. Day when you I pray for all the family all the family even the world that's going on. Saying I hope that all the scenes that they had and hope hope there's all forgiven and they all went to heaven from the beginning. Till now and they met there and to take care of all the family. Keep it all strong and healthy safe close respected him and I respect each other and doing the right thing and forgive us for our sins if these No I just this is leave when you go to heaven you pray. So for the families and loved ones and their sense of forgive and that they go to hell and they meet and they're just waiting for. This. I pray you get this sense was given given my sense meet them in heaven when the time comes yes I do. Yes I do. I do. Because like keep saying if you don't do the right thing that's what you're going to punish you're going to jail. 
No I'm not really I don't believe that. 
I want to thank him for everything and continue to watch all the family after I'm gone guidance and protect. 
He didn't close loving caring and respect him and respect each other and doing the right thing by the you have a company like you and I do want us to cease to be the yes. 
God has friends to protect us right. I believe that that's why I say you do the right thing and there there and that you know you must do the right thing and that could change the right thing. 
Show God how much you appreciate that. Yes. Is too. You know that's anything that makes you feel like oh my showing the same thing I have that has been all times I feel like families watching this guys watch it. All. 
Family. That's the way I feel about it. 
I like to know. Let them know that I respect and respect each other and doing the right thing by all means and you do the right thing. To continue to do the right thing and I'm respect that show got out I would appreciate your life that you gone. 
No it is just to keep us close and loving and caring for each other because of what to do the right thing by all means. I to say show that you love you and don't be respectful for all thing. 
That's the most important thing that if you do something wrong things start to turn you around because we all make some mistakes. Q How minor or major it is you ask God to forgive you. And you do or you do the right thing. That's what counts. And. 
Jobs. I only had a job. I worked at. 
Westinghouse and that was an 18 year yes. 
It was assembly work on the line when I became supervisor. I became a job foreman I had like a hundred and fifty people work at and it was very rough because I was the first female the first black there. There and all races and nationalities. So many of them was against me but I kept praying and asking God to help me and keep smiling and this we at ended up to the end. I retired. This. 
Someone someone told me I can't think how I've got the I really don't remember around no only my nephew right. 
I once once I've been the work of one summer while he was at school. Then he went back to college dad and I were just a couple months and that was it. 
Yes I loved my job. 
I loved it. I enjoyed it. There was a rough job with the hatred in any and all races races nationalities but I was determined the next guy to help me keep me safe and doing the right thing. And that's why I was able to advance and get the promotion because like I said I will be. Both of those the same way. So many so many of them in the salary on the management those voices of a allowed the world as many as out it was worse because there was envious of me getting the job and being a female and being black.
